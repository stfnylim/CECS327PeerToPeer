# CECS327PeerToPeer

Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application is to enable peer to peer network communication. A program which allows two or more computers to synchronize files across a local area network
(LAN). Each computer should run its own local instance of the client software, and the files which will be
synchronized should be able to be synchronized multi-directionally.
Example:
Nodes P1, P2, . . . Pn have clients C1, C2, . . . Cn installed on each node respectively. F1, F2, . . . Fn
are sets of files where F1 is the set of files on node P1, F2 is the set of files on node P2, and so forth.
The goal of your program should be the unification of all sets of files, F, so that Pi
, Ci âˆª {Fj} on each
client.
